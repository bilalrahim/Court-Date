Introduction:
 The database system would help a defendant/lawyer quickly find when and where he/she needs to appear in court for criminal and infraction cases. They can get to know their date and time of appearance from anyplace, they won’t have to deal with the hassle of going to court to only find out their date of appearance.
Objective:
•	Would save plenty of time.
•	Save travel cost.
Deliverable:
At the end of the project a deployable database system would be shown, which would be able to tell you your date and location of your court appearance.
Scope: 
Everyday thousands of people have to cancel out their important meetings or leave work to go to court to only find out their date of appearance. With such a databases system they won’t have to cancel any meeting or leave their work.
